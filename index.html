        <h1>Portfolio Index</h1>
        <p>Hello there, welcome to my portfolio. This main purpose of this site is to archive all the things I have done and will do. It will be nothing too fancy and will probably consist mostly of me monologuing to myself, but you're free to join.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Currently an Undergraduate student studying at an undisclosed university, studying mechanical engineering. I plan to pursue graduate school to conduct research get a PhD. It is difficult to say what I will do research on, but my current interests revolve heavily around unmaned systems, automata, and artificial life. Right now though I'm just kinda taking things as they come along living life day by day.</p>
