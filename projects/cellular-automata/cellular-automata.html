        <h1>Cellular Automata</h1>
        <p>Oh boy, where do I even begin with this topic... Well for starters, a Cellular Automation is sort of an iterative computation / generation of cells, of which is controled by some form of rule. Wolfram studied them in depth and has quite a bit documented about them in his research. There are Elementry cellular automata which are 1 dimensional, and then there is totalistic cellular automata which can be 1 dimensional, 2 dimensional, 3 dimensional, and probably more. Key difference here is that Elementry cellular automata cells have a binary state, on / off, while in totalistic cellular automata there can K total states. Totalistic cellular automata also use the averages of the neighboring cells to determine the current cells next state. These definitions were created by Wolfram and are easily to mathematically define, which makes sense given who he is. Nonetheless, I have made programs written in C to simulate these, they are on my github. The most interesting part about Cellular Automata is the patters, or seemingly lack thereof, that evolve throughout the iterations. Some automata seem to spiral into chaos by starting with just one live cell, and some just want to die. The main reason I even stumbled upon such a thing was through my search of artifical life, and I suppose that is what I am to do. Von Neumann and others have created or proposed self-rebuilding machines in cellular automata which certianly seems like a step in the right direction. I plan on looking into their works and seeing if it useful.</p>

        <h2>Creating a Living Piece</h2>
        <p>If one were to go about creating a life form, how would it be done? And at whatpoint do we draw the line between alive and dead? Well, after some thought I feel as if we have already created living things. Think about gliders and puffer trains from John Conways Game Of Life, they're constantly moving and never truly terminate, I think this makes them feel alive. Similarly though that must mean that anything that ocillates is alive, but this doesn't make much sense. I suppose an engine also feels alive, it creates motion on its own ( which I find rather impressive ), but all it really is is mechanical energy that is incapable of operating anything without external control. Oddly enough though we see this oscillation in other things like computer clocks, and nature, which makes me think it is significant to matter of life. In theory though, you could drop the oscillation and just have one long sequence of actions, but I suspect this would exhibit repeated patterns which then ties back to oscillation. Also, oscillation allows for a cycle to repeat allowing for an possibly infinite sequence to be represented as a simple cycle. This cycle however could be infinitely complex, but I think it would still have to be finite and discrete. This is similar to a finite state machine and other automata models we currently have today, so this is not a novel idea. However, if we were to represent life as a FSM then that would mean life can be broken down into discrete steps and computed. This doesn't really sound like the life we know, this theoretical machine would be static, and I think one important part about living things is their ability to autonomously change in some way. Note the world autonomous, it is simple to make a machine that changes its form, I don't think it is so simple to create a machine that dynamically changes its form and alter itself. This is hard to think about because it seems, on an apparent level, that the living things around us grow and develop in seemlingly random ways, and if we were to make this aforementioned machine, it would have to have a concrete reasoning behind its growth and change because our only way of creating machines is discretely. Is it really true though that life is random? I think not, I imagine that living and growing things such as ourselves are just complex dynamic systems, and the only reason it seems random is because it is so complex that the pattern is not easily recognizable. If it is truly not possible that we cannot be represented as a discrete system, then that must mean there is a piece of the puzzle missing in our knowledge. Is it possible that there is another universal element that explains life? Who knows, one can only wonder. I will have to operate under the assumption that such a thing doesn't exist and that we can createa a living piece somehow. Summing it up, I think in order to make something that exhibhits life, we would need to construct a dynamic system that has the ability to alter itself based upon some sort of condition. This sounds similar to genetic alogirthms and Artifical Intelligence so maybe I should look there instead. </p>
